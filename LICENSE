		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

Linux kernel licensing rules
The Linux Kernel is provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 only (GPL-2.0), as provided in LICENSES/preferred/GPL-2.0, with an explicit syscall exception described in LICENSES/exceptions/Linux-syscall-note, as described in the COPYING file.

This documentation file provides a description of how each source file should be annotated to make its license clear and unambiguous. It doesn't replace the Kernel's license.

The license described in the COPYING file applies to the kernel source as a whole, though individual source files can have a different license which is required to be compatible with the GPL-2.0:

GPL-1.0+  :  GNU General Public License v1.0 or later
GPL-2.0+  :  GNU General Public License v2.0 or later
LGPL-2.0  :  GNU Library General Public License v2 only
LGPL-2.0+ :  GNU Library General Public License v2 or later
LGPL-2.1  :  GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 only
LGPL-2.1+ :  GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later
Aside from that, individual files can be provided under a dual license, e.g. one of the compatible GPL variants and alternatively under a permissive license like BSD, MIT etc.

The User-space API (UAPI) header files, which describe the interface of user-space programs to the kernel are a special case. According to the note in the kernel COPYING file, the syscall interface is a clear boundary, which does not extend the GPL requirements to any software which uses it to communicate with the kernel. Because the UAPI headers must be includable into any source files which create an executable running on the Linux kernel, the exception must be documented by a special license expression.

The common way of expressing the license of a source file is to add the matching boilerplate text into the top comment of the file. Due to formatting, typos etc. these "boilerplates" are hard to validate for tools which are used in the context of license compliance.

An alternative to boilerplate text is the use of Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) license identifiers in each source file. SPDX license identifiers are machine parsable and precise shorthands for the license under which the content of the file is contributed. SPDX license identifiers are managed by the SPDX Workgroup at the Linux Foundation and have been agreed on by partners throughout the industry, tool vendors, and legal teams. For further information see https://spdx.org/

The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files. The valid identifiers used in the kernel are explained in the section License identifiers and have been retrieved from the official SPDX license list at https://spdx.org/licenses/ along with the license texts.

License identifier syntax
Placement:

The SPDX license identifier in kernel files shall be added at the first possible line in a file which can contain a comment. For the majority of files this is the first line, except for scripts which require the '#!PATH_TO_INTERPRETER' in the first line. For those scripts the SPDX identifier goes into the second line.


Style:

The SPDX license identifier is added in form of a comment. The comment style depends on the file type:

C source: // SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>
C header: /* SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression> */
ASM:      /* SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression> */
scripts:  # SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>
.rst:     .. SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>
.dts{i}:  // SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>
If a specific tool cannot handle the standard comment style, then the appropriate comment mechanism which the tool accepts shall be used. This is the reason for having the "/* */" style comment in C header files. There was build breakage observed with generated .lds files where 'ld' failed to parse the C++ comment. This has been fixed by now, but there are still older assembler tools which cannot handle C++ style comments.


Syntax:

A <SPDX License Expression> is either an SPDX short form license identifier found on the SPDX License List, or the combination of two SPDX short form license identifiers separated by "WITH" when a license exception applies. When multiple licenses apply, an expression consists of keywords "AND", "OR" separating sub-expressions and surrounded by "(", ")" .

License identifiers for licenses like [L]GPL with the 'or later' option are constructed by using a "+" for indicating the 'or later' option.:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+
// SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-2.1+
WITH should be used when there is a modifier to a license needed. For example, the linux kernel UAPI files use the expression:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note
Other examples using WITH exceptions found in the kernel are:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 WITH mif-exception
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+ WITH GCC-exception-2.0
Exceptions can only be used with particular License identifiers. The valid License identifiers are listed in the tags of the exception text file. For details see the point Exceptions in the chapter License identifiers.

OR should be used if the file is dual licensed and only one license is to be selected. For example, some dtsi files are available under dual licenses:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause
Examples from the kernel for license expressions in dual licensed files:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 OR MIT
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 OR BSD-2-Clause
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 OR MPL-1.1
// SPDX-License-Identifier: (GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-1.0+ OR BSD-3-Clause OR OpenSSL
AND should be used if the file has multiple licenses whose terms all apply to use the file. For example, if code is inherited from another project and permission has been given to put it in the kernel, but the original license terms need to remain in effect:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: (GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT
Another other example where both sets of license terms need to be adhered to is:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-1.0+ AND LGPL-2.1+
License identifiers
The licenses currently used, as well as the licenses for code added to the kernel, can be broken down into:

Preferred licenses:

Whenever possible these licenses should be used as they are known to be fully compatible and widely used. These licenses are available from the directory:

LICENSES/preferred/
in the kernel source tree.

The files in this directory contain the full license text and Metatags. The file names are identical to the SPDX license identifier which shall be used for the license in source files.

Examples:

LICENSES/preferred/GPL-2.0
Contains the GPL version 2 license text and the required metatags:

LICENSES/preferred/MIT
Contains the MIT license text and the required metatags

Metatags:

The following meta tags must be available in a license file:

Valid-License-Identifier:

One or more lines which declare which License Identifiers are valid inside the project to reference this particular license text. Usually this is a single valid identifier, but e.g. for licenses with the 'or later' options two identifiers are valid.

SPDX-URL:

The URL of the SPDX page which contains additional information related to the license.

Usage-Guidance:

Freeform text for usage advice. The text must include correct examples for the SPDX license identifiers as they should be put into source files according to the License identifier syntax guidelines.

License-Text:

All text after this tag is treated as the original license text

File format examples:

Valid-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
Valid-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+
SPDX-URL: https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html

  tag/value pairs into a comment according to the placement
  guidelines in the licensing rules documentation.
  For 'GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 only' use:
    SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
  For 'GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or any later version' use:
    SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+
License-Text:

Deprecated licenses:

These licenses should only be used for existing code or for importing code from a different project. These licenses are available from the directory:

LICENSES/deprecated/
in the kernel source tree.

The files in this directory contain the full license text and Metatags. The file names are identical to the SPDX license identifier which shall be used for the license in source files.

Examples:

LICENSES/deprecated/ISC
Contains the Internet Systems Consortium license text and the required metatags:

LICENSES/deprecated/GPL-1.0
Contains the GPL version 1 license text and the required metatags.

Metatags:

The metatag requirements for 'other' licenses are identical to the requirements of the Preferred licenses.

File format example:

Valid-License-Identifier: ISC
SPDX-URL: https://spdx.org/licenses/ISC.html
Usage-Guide:
  Usage of this license in the kernel for new code is discouraged
  and it should solely be used for importing code from an already
  existing project.
  To use this license in source code, put the following SPDX
  tag/value pair into a comment according to the placement
  guidelines in the licensing rules documentation.
    SPDX-License-Identifier: ISC
License-Text:
  Full license text

Dual Licensing Only

These licenses should only be used to dual license code with another license in addition to a preferred license. These licenses are available from the directory:

LICENSES/dual/
in the kernel source tree.

The files in this directory contain the full license text and Metatags. The file names are identical to the SPDX license identifier which shall be used for the license in source files.

Examples:

LICENSES/dual/MPL-1.1
Contains the Mozilla Public License version 1.1 license text and the required metatags:

LICENSES/dual/Apache-2.0
Contains the Apache License version 2.0 license text and the required metatags.

Metatags:

The metatag requirements for 'other' licenses are identical to the requirements of the Preferred licenses.

File format example:

Valid-License-Identifier: MPL-1.1
SPDX-URL: https://spdx.org/licenses/MPL-1.1.html
Usage-Guide:
  Do NOT use. The MPL-1.1 is not GPL2 compatible. It may only be used for
  dual-licensed files where the other license is GPL2 compatible.
  If you end up using this it MUST be used together with a GPL2 compatible
  license using "OR".
  To use the Mozilla Public License version 1.1 put the following SPDX
  tag/value pair into a comment according to the placement guidelines in
  the licensing rules documentation:
SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-1.1
License-Text:
  Full license text

Exceptions:

Some licenses can be amended with exceptions which grant certain rights which the original license does not. These exceptions are available from the directory:

LICENSES/exceptions/
in the kernel source tree. The files in this directory contain the full exception text and the required Exception Metatags.

Examples:

LICENSES/exceptions/Linux-syscall-note
Contains the Linux syscall exception as documented in the COPYING file of the Linux kernel, which is used for UAPI header files. e.g. /* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note */:

LICENSES/exceptions/GCC-exception-2.0
Contains the GCC 'linking exception' which allows to link any binary independent of its license against the compiled version of a file marked with this exception. This is required for creating runnable executables from source code which is not compatible with the GPL.

Exception Metatags:

The following meta tags must be available in an exception file:

SPDX-Exception-Identifier:

One exception identifier which can be used with SPDX license identifiers.

SPDX-URL:

The URL of the SPDX page which contains additional information related to the exception.

SPDX-Licenses:

A comma separated list of SPDX license identifiers for which the exception can be used.

Usage-Guidance:

Freeform text for usage advice. The text must be followed by correct examples for the SPDX license identifiers as they should be put into source files according to the License identifier syntax guidelines.

Exception-Text:

All text after this tag is treated as the original exception text

File format examples:

SPDX-Exception-Identifier: Linux-syscall-note
SPDX-URL: https://spdx.org/licenses/Linux-syscall-note.html
SPDX-Licenses: GPL-2.0, GPL-2.0+, GPL-1.0+, LGPL-2.0, LGPL-2.0+, LGPL-2.1, LGPL-2.1+
Usage-Guidance:
  This exception is used together with one of the above SPDX-Licenses
  to mark user-space API (uapi) header files so they can be included
  into non GPL compliant user-space application code.
  To use this exception add it with the keyword WITH to one of the
  identifiers in the SPDX-Licenses tag:
    SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX-License> WITH Linux-syscall-note
Exception-Text:
  Full exception text
SPDX-Exception-Identifier: GCC-exception-2.0
SPDX-URL: https://spdx.org/licenses/GCC-exception-2.0.html
SPDX-Licenses: GPL-2.0, GPL-2.0+
Usage-Guidance:
  The "GCC Runtime Library exception 2.0" is used together with one
  of the above SPDX-Licenses for code imported from the GCC runtime
  library.
  To use this exception add it with the keyword WITH to one of the
  identifiers in the SPDX-Licenses tag:
    SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX-License> WITH GCC-exception-2.0
Exception-Text:
  Full exception text
All SPDX license identifiers and exceptions must have a corresponding file in the LICENSES subdirectories. This is required to allow tool verification (e.g. checkpatch.pl) and to have the licenses ready to read and extract right from the source, which is recommended by various FOSS organizations, e.g. the FSFE REUSE initiative.

MODULE_LICENSE
Loadable kernel modules also require a MODULE_LICENSE() tag. This tag is neither a replacement for proper source code license information (SPDX-License-Identifier) nor in any way relevant for expressing or determining the exact license under which the source code of the module is provided.

The sole purpose of this tag is to provide sufficient information whether the module is free software or proprietary for the kernel module loader and for user space tools.

The valid license strings for MODULE_LICENSE() are:

"GPL"	Module is licensed under GPL version 2. This does not express any distinction between GPL-2.0-only or GPL-2.0-or-later. The exact license information can only be determined via the license information in the corresponding source files.
"GPL v2"	Same as "GPL". It exists for historic reasons.
"GPL and additional rights"	Historical variant of expressing that the module source is dual licensed under a GPL v2 variant and MIT license. Please do not use in new code.
"Dual MIT/GPL"	The correct way of expressing that the module is dual licensed under a GPL v2 variant or MIT license choice.
"Dual BSD/GPL"	The module is dual licensed under a GPL v2 variant or BSD license choice. The exact variant of the BSD license can only be determined via the license information in the corresponding source files.
"Dual MPL/GPL"	The module is dual licensed under a GPL v2 variant or Mozilla Public License (MPL) choice. The exact variant of the MPL license can only be determined via the license information in the corresponding source files.
"Proprietary"	The module is under a proprietary license. This string is solely for proprietary third party modules and cannot be used for modules which have their source code in the kernel tree. Modules tagged that way are tainting the kernel with the 'P' flag when loaded and the kernel module loader refuses to link such modules against symbols which are exported with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().
